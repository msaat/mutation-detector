# mutation-detector
A Java program that detects what kind of mutation (frameshift, silent, missense, nonsense) occurred in an inputted DNA sequence. Function amAcGen() in aaGen.java is from amino-acid-generator, a previous repo

How it works:
- input a DNA sequence (or exit to quit)
- input a version of the above DNA sequence with a mutation (or exit to quit)
- the output tells you what kind of mutation is present (frameshift, silent, missense, nonsense)
